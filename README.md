- 👋 Hello! I’m @starchy-tato
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web application development through Manpower's TECHCareers Software Development program, partnered with SAIT. My goal is to learn the technical skills through this program so I am able to transition into the tech industry.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who's able to give me constructive feedback
- 📫 Please shoot me a message to chat =)
