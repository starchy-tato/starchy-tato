- 👋 Hello! I’m @starchy-tato
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my knowledge of front end and back end technologies!
- 🌱 I’m currently completing my internship through Manpower's TECHCareers Software Development program partnered with SAIT. My goal is to develop technical skills through this program so I am able to successfully transition into the tech industry. I was previously a piping designer in O&G.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who's able to give me constructive feedback
- 📫 Please shoot me a message to chat =)
