- 👋 Hello! I’m @starchy-tato
- 📚 I’m interested in expanding my knowledge of front end and back end technologies!
- 🌱 Currently completing an internship with Pixeltree! My goal is to develop technical skills with ruby on rails and react through this experience so I am able to secure a fullstack role in the tech industry. I have a background as a piping designer in O&G.
